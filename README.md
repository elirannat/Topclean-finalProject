## Installation

Hi my name is Eliran Natan and welcome to my React Node.js project
In the above project, I used the technologies that are in demand today in the job market
And I hope you enjoy it
Ok so let's go on a journey together

Let's activate the Server

## Server side

```bash
server/npm i
```

```bash
server/npm run dev

```

That's it, the server is working, 3 cards and 4 different users were created in the database and you can move forward to the client side
don't go anywhere

## client side

```bash
client/npm i
```

```bash
client/npm start
```

That's it, the client is working,

Now that you are inside you can wander around the web and choose who you want to be

I am adding here the list of users and their passwords to make it easier to use
If you don't want to, you can sign up and build your user

```
admin@gmail.com       Aa1234!
bussiness@gmail.com   Aa1234!
regular@gmail.com     Aa1234!
blogger@gmail.com     Aa1234!
```

My recommendation is if you want to see the power of permissions and other cool features, choose admin!!
